Reporting a Bug
===
This is the format you should be using to post a bug report. Standardizing bug reports will make it much MUCH easier to make use of them, and to answer your questions. You will not get official support from us if you fail to read this and follow the format. This is information we need.

**IMPORTANT:** When you run into a bug, quit the game _immediately_ or in the case of a crash, do not reopen it. This will keep the most relevant information to the error at the end of the log.

**IMPORTANT:** Before you report an issue, please make sure it hasn't been reported already. Take a minute to search through _all_ issues, both open and closed.

When posting bugs, please keep to this format.

```
Single or Multiplayer:
Operating System:
Server's Operating System: (only needed if on private server)
Version of Java:
Server's Version of Java: (only needed if on private server)
Pack version: (specific numerical build number)
Description of problem:
Steps to reproduce problem: (Be very detailed here: We can't help you if we can't find the root of the issue)
Crash/error report: (Put ``` on the lines before and after the log. This puts it in a code block)
```

Crash reports are found in one of two places, if the crash happens before the pack has loaded (has not yet reached the main menu), the crash reports are found in the .technic/modpacks/minetek directory, and are generally called 'ForgeModLoader-client-{number}. Find the most recent one, and copy it over.

If the crash happens while the game is running, crash reports are found in the .technic/modpacks/minetek/crash-reports. Find the most recent one, and again, copy it over.

We cannot help you if you do not provide enough information.

If the log is too long to post in an issue, please upload it [here](http://paste.ubuntu.com/). It's like pastebin with no max length.
